That is fear.

                        <h1><span style="color: #df596b">HALF-LOVE</span> AND OTHER REALIZATIONS</h1>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                      <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A long time ago, I realized I don&rsquo;t want to half-love. Scratch that, a long time ago I realized that I simply cannot half-love. I resemble the ocean, with a love so deep it is still mostly unexplored. And in coming to this realization, I came to another: I am not straight. Girls have an appeal to them that cannot simply be ignored, and ignore them I refuse to. So after wrestling with terms, with different identities, with different sexualities, I decided that I am pansexual. From the hijab I wear on my head, to the way my feet hit the ground. I&rsquo;ve decided that gender isn&rsquo;t something that stops me from loving people. It doesn&rsquo;t dictate how much of my soul I am willing to give someone who I decide is worthy of my time. </span></p>
                      <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I this guess explains how I love so haphazardly, so dangerously and randomly, with my friends, or even strangers I see in the dining hall. How I have fallen in love with people of all races, genders, and cultures. How I have fallen out of love with people who deserve better than me or people who just aren&rsquo;t ready for me yet. How I yearn for girls who have the sun in their smiles, for boys who have the moon in their eyes and people who have stars in their veins. My blood is corrupted with this love. A love, a passion, so fierce that I burn with it. But as these truths and thoughts are exposed to the light, I have discovered even more things I cannot ignore, like the toxicity embedded in my bloodline, and the fact that I can never let my family know this part of my life. </span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love my family so much that sometimes my chest hurts. But I fear the backlash of their disapproval. Their homophobia is like pending execution: a knife that hangs over my neck and gives no warning of when it will fall. I fear that if I ever claim this part of my identity in front of them, I will become just another statistic, another percentage, another part of the 40% of homeless youth that identify as LGBTQ+. But it is hard to stay hidden in a family that wants people like you dead, or at least somewhere they can&rsquo;t see them. My mother is my closest confidant, but she is a homophobe who &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t like to be called a homophobe, thank you very much.&rdquo; She&rsquo;ll complain about gay storylines, or tell me how seeing two men kiss makes her stomach churn. If my grandfather asked her if that boy with semi-tight pants is gay, she would reply with a disgusted, &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo; And if I talked back and asked, &ldquo;Does my short hair make me a lesbian?&rdquo; she would hiss, &ldquo;You tryna tell me something?&rdquo; It&#39;s probably fitting that she married my stepfather, a man who talks about a young boy he is paid to take care of with such disgust in his voice, such hatred as he says, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fucking gay. He&rsquo;s a fucking faggot.&rdquo; My older sister, who I consider the wokest member of my family, can understand being gay and being straight. But bisexual? Why don&rsquo;t you just choose a side. Transgender? She doesn&rsquo;t have a set religion but being transgender is unholy. At this point I can&rsquo;t imagine breaching the topic with my southern-raised grandmother. The devout Christian she is and all that.</span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now, I will settle. I may want to be gay and Muslim. I may want to be gay and Black. I may want to be gay and happy. I want to know that if I send my mother a wedding invitation with the words Mrs. and Mrs. on it that she would come. I want my father to walk me down the aisle to the love of my life, no matter who they are. But even if this is something I deserve, it might not be what I get. </span></p>
                      <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am gay and closeted to some of the most important people in my life, but at least I am gay and safe. And I am so lucky to be closeted. It may be a temporary closet, a closet I think many can see through, but I am so lucky that I have it. No one knows what lies beyond that door. Happiness possibly, but getting kicked out, being shunned, or having the gay prayed away have such higher chances and more dire consequences. So maybe the closet is cowardly. But right now there are more important things I should be a martyr for.</span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I realize I love a lot; I love with a passion so fierce it threatens to burn me. I realize I love girls, I love boys, I love people who don&rsquo;t fit perfectly into either, and I love people who are just people. I realize how scared I am that my family will find out. I realize that if that happens, there will be consequences I will have to deal with. I realize that I don&rsquo;t know if I am ready to face those consequences.</span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But my greatest realization is that I am, and will continue to be, good enough. No matter who I love, who loves me, or who will stop loving me.</span></p>

                          <p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide your Barbies in the cabinet and bring out your action figures, take off your mother&#39;s heels, and remove the ponytail from your hair. Although you are not embarrassed by these things, you do not want anyone to see them, especially not your dad. Wait for the house to be empty, then turn it into a runway. Strut through your living room in a beautiful gown and stilettos, pose and purse your lips, look at yourself in the mirror and ponder how much better you would look as a girl. Disregard that thought. When you are done, make sure to place everything back neatly. You cannot get caught in your mother&#39;s closet. </span></p>
                          <p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut your hair short, stock up on clothes from the Gap boy&#39;s section, and replace your high-pitched and feminine tone with something deep and masculine. You cannot keep up your summer habits for the first day of school. Walk over to the boys and quickly think of a girl&rsquo;s name. Tell them about that girl you kissed last month and how smoking hot she was. Then run over to your girlfriends and spill about the cute boy you met. Dramatically roll your eyes and groan during dance class and pretend to be hurt during gym class. Save yourself from the embarrassment of your appalling basketball skills. </span></p>
                          <p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basketball shorts, oversized Nike tees, and Axe deodorant (all the other guys use it)&mdash;three of the most important things on your packing list for camp, you tell your mom. &nbsp;Be prepared and memorize a handful of popular rap songs. Catch yourself before you blurt out, &ldquo;OMG I missed you, Bobby, we&rsquo;re going to have so much fun this summer!&rdquo; Say &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up bro? How&#39;s it going?&rdquo; instead. Keep your eyes down in the shower house and change in the bathroom. Resist attending gossip sessions during free time and instead work on your hoops down by the court. Never pose in the mirror or express interest in the way you look. Remember, it&rsquo;s camp, and the guys never look in the mirror. &nbsp;</span></p>
                          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you can&rsquo;t hide forever&mdash;it will come out someday. You only have one decision, and that is whether to live a life of silence or bravely and happily be who you are.</span></p>

                    <section>
                      <p class="c6"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do you write about something that hurts your soul? How do you simply open up a Word document and start putting words down that have never left your mouth, words that are trapped underneath layers and layers of PTSD and anxiety? It&rsquo;s hard. But it&rsquo;s not as hard as coming to terms with what you are writing </span><span class="c1">about</span><span class="c4 c1">. </span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I am eighteen years old, and I have been raped more times than years I have been alive. My uncle used to babysit me when I was a child. My parents would go out, and he would come over to take care of me. He brought me into my bedroom and played special games with me. He did things to me that would make my mother cry, things that will make my mother cry.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;It took me a long time to understand what he had been doing. It is hard to understand as a kid. You assume that your norm is everyone else&#39;s. As a kid, I went to church every Sunday; until I was in fourth grade, I thought it was something everyone else did too. Just like I thought everyone played special games with their uncles. He always told me I was special and that I couldn&rsquo;t tell anyone, or God would be angry. I loved God more than anything at that point in my life. I was naive. </span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When I went to middle school and took classes such as sex education, I started to realise that the special games weren&rsquo;t normal. At that point it wasn&rsquo;t the wrath of God I was scared of, it was my uncle. But in eighth grade, my uncle was hit by a car right in front of me. The </span><span class="c1">car was a light blue Volkswagen Bug with a tan roof. And that stranger inside, who had </span><span class="c1">had a little too much to drink, saved me. </span><span class="c1">The broken glass on the street saved me. </span><span class="c4 c1">The day after the accident, I told my mother. I described to her every assault I could remember. It gets worse when you can&rsquo;t even remember every time. I have never seen my mother cry the way she did when I first told her. She&rsquo;ll cry like that again. </span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">It has been four years since that day when the Volkswagen Bug set me free. I am a different person. My uncle took so much away from me&mdash;more than just my childhood. He took from me my love of God, my relationship with my parents, my happiness. </span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">I write this in the backseat of my car. This is the only place in my life that I feel safe or comfortable. Yet I hope whoever is reading this feels uncomfortable. Rape is uncomfortable. Your uncle laying you on your bed and putting his penis inside of you is uncomfortable. But if people started to understand, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to be as uncomfortable as I am every single day of my life.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">I am not broken. I am merely bruised. You do not need to treat me like I could fall apart at any moment. I did fall apart, years ago, but I picked myself back up and glued myself together. I hope you can help that someone in your life (and I guarantee there is someone in your life who has been hurt the way I have) feel like I do in the backseat of my light blue Volkswagen Bug. I hope you can save them. </span></p>

                      <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I decided to write this story, it was hard for me to decide what to write about. I am only in high school, but I could fill a novel with the countless times I have been sexually abused or harassed. Most girls you know could do the same. I could write about the creepy teachers that were a little too touchy or the guys who said things that would make their mothers cry. I could write about the panic attacks I&rsquo;ve had in the middle of class because of a look a guy gave me or the weekly therapy sessions that resulted from these experiences. However, I&rsquo;ve decided on one thing that needs to be told. The world needs to hear my story and understand that things like this happen in real life. It&#39;s not just something you see on the news or in movies. It&rsquo;s my life, and I would do anything to change it, but I can&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">. So now you</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;get to read it. Be warned, it&rsquo;s graphic: the story of the day he smiled.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my freshman year I partied a fair amount. I rarely drank, but I attended house parties for Christmas, Halloween, Birthdays, New Years&mdash;events like those. One day all my friends were going to my best friend&rsquo;s boyfriend&rsquo;s house for a party. He was a grade above me, but he and his friends had always been so kind to me, so I decided to join them. It was pretty similar to every other party in my town: music blaring, people drinking and a lot of high schoolers making bad decisions.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wore black shorts, a green shirt that showed my cleavage and one of those giant white sweaters that went down to my knees. It wasn&rsquo;t the sluttiest outfit at the party but I wasn&rsquo;t exactly dressed for church. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on drinking. I never drink&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like the way alcohol feels as it slides down my throat or the fuzzy feeling I get in my head after a drink. But if you&rsquo;ve ever been to a party where everyone is drinking and you&rsquo;re not, you know it can be really hard. People kept asking me if I wanted something to drink, so I went to my friend&#39;s boyfriend and asked him if he had a bottle of water. I was just going to pour it in a red solo cup so I would be able to enjoy my night without getting asked to drink. It didn&rsquo;t seem like a strange request at the time. It&rsquo;s just water. </span><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t trust the tap water in my town</span><span class="c2 c0">, or else I probably would have grabbed a cup and filled it up myself. I wish I had grabbed a cup, but instead, I listened as he pointed to a cooler in the corner of the room.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think my friend put some in there,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something weird about the cooler; it looked out of place. The party was in a nice house, and drinks were served out of the fridge, but the bottled water was in this cooler. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time, but I should have. In the cooler, there were six bottles of Smartwater. They were all lined up, cap up, surrounded by ice. I grabbed one and drank about half the bottle. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t drank it; it looked like just a bottle of water, but I started to feel weird about an hour later. I turned to my best friend, the one whose boyfriend was throwing the party, and told her what was going on. She told me it was probably a mistake but still took me to her boyfriend&rsquo;s room to lie down. </span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better in a bit. I&rsquo;ll come check on you soon,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I </span><span class="c0">la</span><span class="c2 c0">id down on the bed and dozed off. I was fast asleep until I awoke to the sound of the door slamming. Someone had just stormed in, and he was obviously angry. I think it might have taken him a second before he realized I was there. But he did. He did realize. I sat up and looked at him. It wasn&rsquo;t someone I recognized. Despite the fact that it was a small party with many people I knew, he was unfamiliar. He was about six feet tall with blonde hair that was gelled back in a stereotypical fraternity boy hairstyle. He had piercing blue eyes and was wearing my local high school&rsquo;s sweatpants with a New England Patriots shirt.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t recognize him, but I wish I did. I asked him if he was okay since he was visibly angry. I wished I hadn&rsquo;t spoken to him. He muttered something about his girlfriend, vodka, and some guy named Joey. I couldn&rsquo;t make out the rest, but at that point, I fearfully suspected that he was ready to take his anger out on me. I moved back in the bed so my back was pushed against the headboard, hands gripping the sheets. My heart beat faster and faster. I recognized what was happening.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked me in the eyes for the first time and smiled. It wasn&rsquo;t an enduring smile that you get from your mom or a sympathetic &ldquo;you failed your test&rdquo; smile you that you would get from your math teacher. It was the type of smile that you see in the movies when the bad guy is about to blow something up or kidnap the damsel. I wish he hadn&rsquo;t smiled. </span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crawled on to the end of the bed and inspected me for a second, scanning me up and down. He told me how beautiful I was and how I was going to make the perfect girlfriend. He explained that since I was his new girlfriend, I was going to have to sleep with him. He started crawling on top of me, grabbing my wrists and sliding my body down underneath his. Every fiber of my being froze. He took off my white sweater and sniffed it like it was a drug. He then unbuttoned my shorts and threw them in the corner. Next, he forcefully ripped my shirt off, like they do in the movies during sex scenes. I was in his now.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he released me and stood up. I wish I had escaped. But I just watched him stare at me, deciding all the things he was going to do to me. And then he smiled.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on and tell you about how he pinned me down and raped me, but I won&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t need to, because his initial smile haunts me more than anything he did to me. I see that smile every time I close my eyes. I relive the experience every time someone smiles at me the same way. At that moment I knew I would never be happy again. </span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are reading this and feeling bad for me, don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t need your pity; I need you to do something about it. &nbsp;</span></p>

                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;German is a remarkably logical language. Unlike English, it is pronounced phonetically, with no silent letters or exceptions in pronunciation. It has clear rules for declension and verb conjugation, and there are three grammatical genders.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gender assignment, however, is German&rsquo;s most glaring area of irregularity. As Mark Twain once famously complained, it is a language in which the translation of the word &lsquo;turnip&rsquo; (</span><span class="c1 c4">&lsquo;die R&uuml;be&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">) is defined to be feminine, while &lsquo;the girl&rsquo; translates to </span><span class="c1 c4">&lsquo;das M&auml;dchen,&rsquo;</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;a noun of gender neutrality. Its three genders are often assigned to nouns with ambiguous reasoning, and they seem to have little correlation with modern societal views of gender.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But to native German speakers, the language&rsquo;s inconsistencies aren&rsquo;t a common topic of discussion; its &lsquo;flaws,&rsquo; if recognized as such, go mainly uncommented upon in the dialect&rsquo;s daily usage. By labelling words and concepts with the articles </span><span class="c1 c4">der, die </span><span class="c1">or</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;das, </span><span class="c2 c1">the German language outlines the intellectual space that various ideas occupy and defines its speakers&rsquo; lingual connotations of gender. To the German speaker, the terms for &lsquo;kitchen&rsquo; and &lsquo;woman&rsquo; are perpetually linked in their language, regardless of their personal views on gender roles, expectations or stereotypes.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I started learning German, I bought into its gendered philosophy. I didn&rsquo;t do so explicitly&mdash;rather, I made subconscious associations between various concepts. I followed the lingual guidelines I was being taught and categorized nouns as masculine, feminine or neuter.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">The first day of my freshman year in high school, I walked into my German class barely capable of speaking coherent English. My nerves rushed my thoughts, muffled my words and highlighted my lisp. So, when the ancient and jovial teacher, Herr Schuster decided we should introduce ourselves to the class, my vision blurred and my words slurred, and a wave of nausea came over my body.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;mRaj,I&rsquo;mfromNashua,NewHampshire,&rdquo; I mumbled, drunk with apprehension. I lowered my eyes and studied my shoelaces.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My classmates responded with blank stares, and a surge of heat came over my face. I repeated myself, louder this time, and glanced up at the classroom.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That term, my German class was overwhelmingly white and male. Of the nine students in the class, I was the only student of color, and I counted just two girls. I was one of two freshmen, and after my first day, I was terrified of the class. But not only that, I was mostly afraid of the overwhelming, pedantic German language.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As time passed, I began to bond with my peers despite our differences. We shared common struggles in learning </span><span class="c1 c4">der Akkusativ</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;or in pop quizzes on nouns&rsquo; genders or verb conjugation. The older students took me under their wing and helped me adjust to boarding school life.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a few weeks, I finally knew everyone by name. There was Will, the drowsy, good-natured senior who kept sleeping through class; there was Alexander, who came from St. Petersburg; and then there were the two girls, Sophia and Alex. Every day, we spoke broken German together. Our class was united in our struggles with collective American inflection.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I grew more comfortable with German&rsquo;s various tenses and grammatical gender rules, I also started to see the unspoken differences between us all.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On one bright November morning, Herr Schuster taught us about the German household.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;In families, siblings, or sometimes close friends, give each other nicknames.&rdquo; He articulated each word with </span><span class="c1 c4">perfekter, nativer Deutsch, </span><span class="c1">and we absorbed his words into our burgeoning vocabularies. &ldquo;For boys, I might call Raj </span><span class="c1 c4">&lsquo;der Raj,&rsquo; </span><span class="c2 c1">since we are very good friends.&rdquo; Herr Schuster flashed me a wink.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;For girls, it is very simple &ndash; we say, &lsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">die Sophia,</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">or perhaps, &lsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">die Alex.</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">This way, we can tell between &lsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">der Alex,</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;&rdquo; he continued, gesturing towards Alexander, &ldquo;or</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;&lsquo;die Alex.&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;He gestured towards Alex, and I saw flashes of red appear in her cheeks.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alex and I were friends, but although I never mentioned it to her face, I had always noticed something different about her. She always wore men&rsquo;s clothes, for one, complete with the button-down dress-shirt and a tie. She spoke in a deep voice, for a girl. She cut her hair short and cropped the sides, like Cristiano Ronaldo. I always assumed her name to be short for Alexis, or something like that: a girl&rsquo;s name.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After class that day, I saw her get up and confront Herr Schuster, but he returned her whispers with a blank, unseeing stare. He had taught German for 40 years; he was too entrenched in the language to understand the harm he caused with his words.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the rest of the term, my classmates and I walked into the classroom every morning, as per usual, and went about our typical </span><span class="c1 c4">Deutsch Smalltalk</span><span class="c1">. We wished each other &lsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">Guten Morgen,</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">we asked each other &lsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">Wie geht es dir?</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">and when we took attendance, we looked around and told Herr Schuster that &lsquo;</span><span class="c1 c4">der Will ist wahrscheinlich noch im Bett,&rsquo; </span><span class="c1">or that </span><span class="c1 c4">&lsquo;die Alex ist krank</span><span class="c2 c1">,&rsquo; and that she was in the Health Center.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t until a health class during the spring of my freshman year that I first heard the terms &lsquo;gender expression&rsquo;, &lsquo;gender spectrum&rsquo; or &lsquo;gender fluidity.&rsquo; I never learned their German translations.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through my language in our German class, I had robbed Alex of his identity. Despite his efforts to express his gender as male, I was too stuck in my ways, too close-minded and too entrenched in my self-imposed prisons of oppressive language. In English and German, I had always referred to Alex with the incorrect pronouns&mdash;my words outlined the intellectual space in which I considered his identity, and I was complicit in defining the hostile, gendered societal environment that infringed upon Alex&rsquo;s personhood. </span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As members of society, our words hold crucial weight. It is through the usage and spread of language that societal values are developed and maintained, and it is through the language surrounding us that our identities are shaped. When we, as individuals, use language to express the association of negative connotations with others&rsquo; identities, we contribute to the perpetuation of hostile, bigoted and oppressive environments.</span></p>
                      <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did not intend to subject Alex to discrimination. He is my friend, and I hold no hatred towards any aspect of his identity. But when I failed to consider the implications of my language, I upheld our society&rsquo;s systems of oppression.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Logic implies that sticks and stones break our bones, but society isn&rsquo;t defined by logic. It is through our language that society defines our identities; it is our language that has the power to inflict and heal wounds. In choosing our words, we choose whether to uplift or hold down the oppressed.</span></p>

                        <h1>THE ISSUE WITH THE LGBT LABEL</h1>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gender non-conforming community has long sought visibility and equality with traditionally accepted genders and sexual orientations. The creation of the LGBT acronym was essential to do so. However, this label can be restrictive and can</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">even limit the pursuit of the equality it was created for.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An acronym like</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">LGBT</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; is useful for presenting a unified group when it comes to writing laws or receiving support from human rights organizations. It provides a sort of common language to ensure that officials or organizations all legislate or donate with the same group of people in mind. The creation of the LGBT category helps such social efforts because it defines specific groups of people according to their gender and sexuality, making them visible as a group to lawmakers rather than as parts of separate demographics. It also presents a standard for the media, eliminating confusion when referring to the LGBT community in news </span><span class="c1">article</span><span class="c1">s or </span><span class="c1">broadcasts.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This unification is essential for mobilizing support and creating a public profile and campaign for equal rights. LGBT gives people something to identify with and rally behind, rather than fumbling for different words to describe their gender or orientation. Previously, anyone that didn&rsquo;t conform to traditional ideas of gender and sexuality was either &ldquo;gay&rdquo; or &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; However, the LGBT acronym and its extensions take more people into account.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">LGBT</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; label also allows people to personalize their ideas of self rather than being referred to by a blanket term chosen by outsiders. &ldquo;Lesbian&rdquo; was added so that women had a separate identifier from &ldquo;gay,&rdquo; and additional labels were created to further clarify where people stood on the spectrum of sexuality. Using </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a label created by the LGBT community for its members gives people a sense of pride in who they are, while enabling more accurate discussion about the issue of LGBT rights.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Members of the LGBT community no longer have to be grouped as &ldquo;gay&rdquo; because others can&rsquo;t understand anything beyond that. Now there are labels for almost every orientation. In some cases, the acronym is expanded to LGBPTTQQIIAA+ in an effort for greater inclusion.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therein lies the </span><span class="c1">problem</span><span class="c1">. LGBT is not nearly nuanced enough to include the vastness of the gender and sexuality spectrum. Adding a plus sign to the end arguably does an even greater disservice, and including the identity &ldquo;questioning&rdquo; invites a host of negative jokes. An expanded label like the one above may alienate those who find it confusing and too complicated, which often results in a negative perception of the LGBT community as a whole. The labels created for the sake of increased visibility and equality only scratch the surface of someone&rsquo;s sexualty, while at the same time restricting them to a </span><span class="c1">singular category. </span><span class="c1">People now have labels that were once liberating forced upon them when they have to check a box that says &ldquo;LGBT,&rdquo; without acknowledging that there are more than four points on the spectrum.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The LGBT acronym that is useful for presenting unity in the media, but</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">also restricts LGBT people to a specific identifier. Instead of being recognized as a person with countless facets, </span><span class="c1">they can now be referred to as </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;the gay/lesbian/queer/questioning&rdquo; kid.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The LGBT label can also have downsides in lawmaking or philanthropic use. </span><span class="c1">Human rights organizations can claim to be LGBT allies, while only aiding a specific group of people. They can focus funding and campaigning on behalf of transgender people, while disregarding the struggle for the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and many more who may not identify with any label yet.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Laws protecting LGBT rights can also potentially be applied only to those four labels, while leaving </span><span class="c1">gender non-conforming people</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;unprotected and not recognized by the state.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some even claim that the LGBT acronym goes too much in the way of separating the community from cisgender heterosexual people. They argue that it becomes a way of pulling apart rather than joining together, and in that way it defeats its own purpose of equality. Furthermore, a four-letter acronym doesn&rsquo;t let allies know where they stand, if they are welcome or unwelcome. Most of all, however, the controversy over choosing a label for such an expansive and diverse group often </span><span class="c1">discourages the uninformed from learning about the LGBT cause.</span></p>
                      <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the goal truly is to build support, raise </span><span class="c1">awareness</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and create equality for gender and sexual minorities, the intentions and executions of such labels are in dire need of reform.</span></p>
