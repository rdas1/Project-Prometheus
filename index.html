That is fear.

                        <h1>Half-Love & Other Realizations</h1>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                      <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A long time ago, I realized I don&rsquo;t want to half-love. Scratch that, a long time ago I realized that I simply cannot half-love. I resemble the ocean, with a love so deep it is still mostly unexplored. And in coming to this realization, I came to another: I am not straight. Girls have an appeal to them that cannot simply be ignored, and ignore them I refuse to. So after wrestling with terms, with different identities, with different sexualities, I decided that I am pansexual. From the hijab I wear on my head, to the way my feet hit the ground. I&rsquo;ve decided that gender isn&rsquo;t something that stops me from loving people. It doesn&rsquo;t dictate how much of my soul I am willing to give someone who I decide is worthy of my time. </span></p>
                      <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I this guess explains how I love so haphazardly, so dangerously and randomly, with my friends, or even strangers I see in the dining hall. How I have fallen in love with people of all races, genders, and cultures. How I have fallen out of love with people who deserve better than me or people who just aren&rsquo;t ready for me yet. How I yearn for girls who have the sun in their smiles, for boys who have the moon in their eyes and people who have stars in their veins. My blood is corrupted with this love. A love, a passion, so fierce that I burn with it. But as these truths and thoughts are exposed to the light, I have discovered even more things I cannot ignore, like the toxicity embedded in my bloodline, and the fact that I can never let my family know this part of my life. </span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love my family so much that sometimes my chest hurts. But I fear the backlash of their disapproval. Their homophobia is like pending execution: a knife that hangs over my neck and gives no warning of when it will fall. I fear that if I ever claim this part of my identity in front of them, I will become just another statistic, another percentage, another part of the 40% of homeless youth that identify as LGBTQ+. But it is hard to stay hidden in a family that wants people like you dead, or at least somewhere they can&rsquo;t see them. My mother is my closest confidant, but she is a homophobe who &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t like to be called a homophobe, thank you very much.&rdquo; She&rsquo;ll complain about gay storylines, or tell me how seeing two men kiss makes her stomach churn. If my grandfather asked her if that boy with semi-tight pants is gay, she would reply with a disgusted, &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo; And if I talked back and asked, &ldquo;Does my short hair make me a lesbian?&rdquo; she would hiss, &ldquo;You tryna tell me something?&rdquo; It&#39;s probably fitting that she married my stepfather, a man who talks about a young boy he is paid to take care of with such disgust in his voice, such hatred as he says, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fucking gay. He&rsquo;s a fucking faggot.&rdquo; My older sister, who I consider the wokest member of my family, can understand being gay and being straight. But bisexual? Why don&rsquo;t you just choose a side. Transgender? She doesn&rsquo;t have a set religion but being transgender is unholy. At this point I can&rsquo;t imagine breaching the topic with my southern-raised grandmother. The devout Christian she is and all that.</span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right now, I will settle. I may want to be gay and Muslim. I may want to be gay and Black. I may want to be gay and happy. I want to know that if I send my mother a wedding invitation with the words Mrs. and Mrs. on it that she would come. I want my father to walk me down the aisle to the love of my life, no matter who they are. But even if this is something I deserve, it might not be what I get. </span></p>
                      <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am gay and closeted to some of the most important people in my life, but at least I am gay and safe. And I am so lucky to be closeted. It may be a temporary closet, a closet I think many can see through, but I am so lucky that I have it. No one knows what lies beyond that door. Happiness possibly, but getting kicked out, being shunned, or having the gay prayed away have such higher chances and more dire consequences. So maybe the closet is cowardly. But right now there are more important things I should be a martyr for.</span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I realize I love a lot; I love with a passion so fierce it threatens to burn me. I realize I love girls, I love boys, I love people who don&rsquo;t fit perfectly into either, and I love people who are just people. I realize how scared I am that my family will find out. I realize that if that happens, there will be consequences I will have to deal with. I realize that I don&rsquo;t know if I am ready to face those consequences.</span></p>
                      <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But my greatest realization is that I am, and will continue to be, good enough. No matter who I love, who loves me, or who will stop loving me.</span></p>

                          <p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Hide your Barbies in the cabinet and bring out your action figures, take off your mother&#39;s heels, and remove the ponytail from your hair. Although you are not embarrassed by these things, you do not want anyone to see them, especially not your dad. Wait for the house to be empty, then turn it into a runway. Strut through your living room in a beautiful gown and stilettos, pose and purse your lips, look at yourself in the mirror and ponder how much better you would look as a girl. Disregard that thought. When you are done, make sure to place everything back neatly. You cannot get caught in your mother&#39;s closet. </span></p>
                          <p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut your hair short, stock up on clothes from the Gap boy&#39;s section, and replace your high-pitched and feminine tone with something deep and masculine. You cannot keep up your summer habits for the first day of school. Walk over to the boys and quickly think of a girl&rsquo;s name. Tell them about that girl you kissed last month and how smoking hot she was. Then run over to your girlfriends and spill about the cute boy you met. Dramatically roll your eyes and groan during dance class and pretend to be hurt during gym class. Save yourself from the embarrassment of your appalling basketball skills. </span></p>
                          <p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basketball shorts, oversized Nike tees, and Axe deodorant (all the other guys use it)&mdash;three of the most important things on your packing list for camp, you tell your mom. &nbsp;Be prepared and memorize a handful of popular rap songs. Catch yourself before you blurt out, &ldquo;OMG I missed you, Bobby, we&rsquo;re going to have so much fun this summer!&rdquo; Say &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up bro? How&#39;s it going?&rdquo; instead. Keep your eyes down in the shower house and change in the bathroom. Resist attending gossip sessions during free time and instead work on your hoops down by the court. Never pose in the mirror or express interest in the way you look. Remember, it&rsquo;s camp, and the guys never look in the mirror. &nbsp;</span></p>
                          <p class="c1"><span class="c3">But you can&rsquo;t hide forever&mdash;it will come out someday. You only have one decision, and that is whether to live a life of silence or bravely and happily be who you are.</span></p>
